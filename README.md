## Miscellaneous functions for working with AGK

These are all functions that may or may not turn into their own modules eventually. 

All these functions are static from the GameUtils class.

To see everything, simply check out it's JSDoc.

## Installation

Using NPM:
npm install agk-utils

## Function list

*calculateAngle(x1, y1, x2, y2)
* Distance3D(x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2)
* Distance(x1, y1, x2, y2)
* getRandomArbitrary(min, max) // floating point random numbers between min and max
* isCollide3D(a, b) // a.x, a.y, a.z, b.x, b.y, b.z collide
* randomInt(min, max)

## Contributing

Really it's just a set of miscellaneous functions that haven't yet made it into their own module. I hope to change this eventually.
